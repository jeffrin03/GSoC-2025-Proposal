Title:
Enhancing the Folksonomy Engine for Smarter Food Tagging in Open Food Facts

Description:
Open Food Facts relies on user-generated tags (folksonomy) to categorize millions of food products. However, inconsistency, duplication, and multilingual variations make tag management challenging. This project aims to improve the Folksonomy Engine by implementing a Python-based pipeline for tag cleaning, normalization, and clustering using data analysis techniques. It will help the platform achieve better data organization, multilingual search accuracy, and a cleaner tagging system — enhancing both developer experience and user satisfaction.

Expected Outcomes:
Deliverables:
- A tag-cleaning and normalization module (Python-based)
- Multilingual and synonymous tag grouping system
- Integrated test results using real product data
- Final codebase with documentation and usage guide

KPI / Benefits:
- Improved tag consistency and reduced redundancy
- Enhanced tag-based search and filtering accuracy
- Easier tag management for maintainers and contributors
